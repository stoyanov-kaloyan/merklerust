> Rust-powered Merkle trees & proofs for Node.js

Lightweight bindings exposing fast Merkle tree construction and proof generation from Rust to JavaScript (Node.js).

Quickstart

-   Build native bindings: `pnpm run build` (requires Rust toolchain).
-   Use the exported API from `index.js` and import types from `index.d.ts`.
